**Attempting a One-Command Installation (Highly Experimental, Limited Support):**

**WARNING: This is an experimental approach. It relies on the user having `curl` and `bash` available (common on Linux/macOS, less so on Windows). It may not work reliably on all systems.**

1.  **Run the following command in your terminal:**

    ```bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Velaire/StellarWave/main/install.sh)
    ```

**Important Notes:**

* **Windows Users:** This one-command approach is unlikely to work reliably on Windows. Please follow the "Manual Installation" instructions.
* **Dependency Issues:** This script assumes you have Git, Node.js, and npm already installed and properly configured. If not, the installation will fail.
* **Security:** Be cautious when running scripts downloaded from the internet. Always review the code before executing it.
* **Reliability:** The manual installation is always the most reliable way to install StellarWave.
